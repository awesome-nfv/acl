acl
===

Network access control list parsing library.

This is being forked from the ACL lib that is bundled with `Trigger
<https://github.com/aol/trigger>`_. The goal is to pull this out of Trigger and
have it be a stand-alone project. Once it becomes stable, it will be pulled out
of Trigger core and converted into an optional feature.

**UNTIL THIS IS DONE THIS LIBRARY IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE BROKEN**
